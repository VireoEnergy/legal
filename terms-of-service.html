  <h1>Run on Sun – Terms of Service</h1>
  <p><strong>Effective date:</strong> 10 November 2026</p>

  <h2>1. Purpose of the App</h2>
  <p><em>Run on Sun</em> is operated by Vireo Energy Pty Ltd (“we”, “our”, or “us”). The App provides solar forecasting and appliance scheduling tools to help users align energy use with solar generation. The App is for informational and educational purposes only and should not be relied upon for operational, financial, or safety-critical decisions.</p>

  <h2>2. Forecast Accuracy and Limitations</h2>
  <p>We use third-party weather and solar data sources and our own algorithms to generate forecasts. Because solar generation depends on many uncontrollable factors—such as weather, shading, and system performance—<strong>we cannot guarantee that any forecast or suggestion will reflect actual solar output or energy savings</strong>.</p>
  <p>You acknowledge that forecasts are estimates only, and real-world results may differ. We are not liable for any losses, damages, or missed savings resulting from reliance on forecasts or recommendations.</p>

  <h2>3. User Responsibilities</h2>
  <p>You are responsible for ensuring your site details and appliance settings are accurate. The App may provide recommendations, but you make the final decisions about when and how to operate your appliances. The App does not directly control equipment unless explicitly stated for compatible devices.</p>

  <h2>4. Subscriptions and Payments</h2>
  <p>The App offers both free and paid subscription plans. Paid features may include extended forecast days, unlimited appliances, and advanced insights.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Subscriptions are billed through Apple App Store or Google Play.</li>
    <li>Payment terms, renewals, and cancellations are handled by those platforms.</li>
    <li>You can cancel anytime through your app store account settings.</li>
    <li>No refunds are offered for partial subscription periods.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>5. Data and Privacy</h2>
  <p>Your privacy is important to us. The App collects minimal information, such as your chosen location and appliance details, to deliver its features. Please review our <a href="https://vireoenergy.github.io/legal/privacy-policy.html">Privacy Policy</a> for details.</p>

  <h2>6. Limitation of Liability</h2>
  <p>To the fullest extent permitted by law:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>The App and all information are provided “as is” without warranties of any kind.</li>
    <li>We disclaim all implied warranties, including accuracy, reliability, or fitness for purpose.</li>
    <li>We are not responsible for any loss of data, system damage, or financial loss arising from use of or reliance on the App.</li>
    <li>Our total liability, if any, is limited to the amount paid (if any) for your subscription in the 12 months prior to the claim.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>7. Changes and Availability</h2>
  <p>We may update, modify, or discontinue any part of the App at any time without notice. These Terms may also be updated periodically. Continued use of the App means you accept any updated Terms.</p>

  <h2>8. Governing Law</h2>
  <p>These Terms are governed by the laws of Victoria, Australia. You agree to submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts located in Victoria for any disputes related to these Terms.</p>

  <h2>9. Contact</h2>
  <p>If you have any questions about these Terms, please contact us at:</p>
